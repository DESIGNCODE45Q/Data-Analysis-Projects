###Project: Weather Data Analysis##

1. Data Collection and Preparation: Gathered weather data, performed cleaning, and prepared the dataset using Pandas.
2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Conducted detailed EDA to identify trends, patterns, and outliers in the weather data.
3. Statistical Analysis: Calculated key statistics such as mean, standard deviation, and correlation coefficients to summarize data insights.
4. Data Visualization: Created comprehensive visualizations using Matplotlib and Seaborn to effectively present temperature trends, wind speed distribution, and other weather metrics.
5. Trend Analysis: Analyzed temporal trends to identify changes in weather conditions over time.
6. Reporting: Generated detailed reports highlighting key weather patterns, visibility trends, and pressure variations for stakeholders.
